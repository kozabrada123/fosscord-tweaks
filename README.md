# fosscord-tweaks
Small tweaks for [fosscord server](https://github.com/fosscord/fosscord-server).

Currently only includes a [tweak that hides all broken features](remove_broken_features.css).
Install the css file by putting it in your `/assets/` folder as `user.css` and the running the server with `npm run start` so the assets cache resets.
